# ChromeDump
Prior to running this you need to run a procdump of Chrome.exe, then convert the .dmp file to something a bit more readable. This script will then search through with some horrific regex and try to find some credentials. Mainly aiming for o365 plaintext, but it can find others. 
There are probably better ways to do this....but meh! It works (for me anyway!)
